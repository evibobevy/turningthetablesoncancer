				<h2>Meet Lena ... Our Inspiration</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>DEAR FRIENDS --</p>
					<p>We underestimate how one word can change your life forever. Cancer. It seems to effect everyone in one way or another. As an independent, excited 22 year old, I never imagined that a simple pain in my knee would result in being told I have cancer. On October 7, 2013, I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and my world has not been the same since. Its hard to wrap your head around the idea that your body is trying to kill you. I could spend a lifetime wondering "why me, why now?", instead, I think I am lucky in a way. Despite the days I feel like I could crawl in a hole and never reappear, or when I was told I was in remission when I wasn't, even knowing that my chances of living past 5 years are small, I have realized that I took everything in life prior to my diagnosis for grated. I may not live forever, may not live long, but I am alive , and I have discovered that life is so magical. I have been fortunate to travel around the world, but there is no greater journey than discovering who you truly are and what you stand for. I stand for life and happiness.</p>
					<p>I am so excited to be a part of this benefit to raise money in the fight against cancer. If just one person is saved from this, or doesn't have to go through what I have, we've changed the world in a positive way. Although my life has been on hold for the past year, music has remained a passion and escape from reality for me. There is no greater feeling in the world than playing music for a crowd and feeling their energy. Its like you can reach your hands out and feel the love in the air. When I am DJing, there are no other thoughts in my mind. Just the music, and my heart. I don't feel sick, or care about what chemo Im getting the next day, or that I'm loosing my hair. Time freezes and the moment is golden. To be able to DJ and raise money to fight this awful disease at the same time is a dream come true for me.</p>
					<p>So thank you a million times for being a part of this amazing event, it truly means to me and to every single person with cancer.  --With Love, LENAÂ KELLER</p>
